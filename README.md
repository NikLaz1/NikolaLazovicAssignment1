So i took the initial HTML file and refactored it to include the following:
1) More SEO friendly. This includes the tags at the beginning and the links.
1b) SEO friendly meta tags
1c) Open graph tag
1d) Twitter card tag
1e) Robots tag
1f) Canonical tag
1g) No follow link
1h) An SEO friendly title
2) More Clear and concise HTML structuring.
3) More clear id tags on the elements that needed them. 
4) I also refactored the code using Bootstrap to do the following:
4b) Include a responsive layout for smaller screens.
4c) Included a navbar which collapses and hamburgers the toggle options for smaller screens.
4d) Swaps the large layout for the small one once the screen size changes to fit the criteria of small screens,
and vice vera for large screens.
4e) Made sure to swap out the floats for the smaller screen html configuration so that the pictures align prop-
erly.
4f) Using the classes "d-none d-lg-block" and "d-lg-none" i was able to create the changing layout between large and small screens.
5) Created semantic html elements and made sure they fall in sequential order.
6) Made sure that all the images had proper alt attributes. 
7) I commented some of the changes that were more nuanced so that they can be identified.
